These are all of the exported model files for Rocco from Tinkercad.

The model is online here:

It should not be printed to a 3D printer currently because the holes don't line up quite right.

When I started assembling the first leg I had to widen most of the holes and even move some of them.  This is possibly because the servo dimensions aren't exact.  I will try to fix the model when I build the rest of the legs.
